# Functional Programming: What, why and how?

This repository contains my .Rmd files used to create my functional programming presentation for the [PHUSE EU CONNECT 2022](https://www.phuse-events.org/attend/frontend/reg/thome.csp?pageID=8190&eventID=16&CSPCHD=001001000000tg52APPf4po7v7gym9gYzAaX_mt2EbB4Ip0xAz).
You should be able to download and knit these files yourself.

**NOTE: I have created a custom `tex` theme which you may have to remove in order to knit the main file.**

## Files

 * `functional_programming.Rmd` - This is the main presentation, knitting to both a beamer presentation and a PDF article in one file!!
 * `pdf_sas_highlight.Rmd` - This describes how to get SAS highlighting in knitted PDF. [NOTE: this will not run the SAS code]
 * `pdf_article_and_slides.Rmd` - This describes how to knit to both PDF presentation and Markdown in a single slide [WIP]
